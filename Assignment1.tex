\section{\protect\bigskip Introduction}

In this first assignment, it was asked to create two random samples X and Y
respectively, of 1000 observations from an i.i.d N(0,1) distribution where Y
has a 10\% correlation with X. Afterwards, a simple OLS regression of Y on X
should be provided and perform a regression analysis

\bigskip 

\section{Implementation}

By performing the following regression:

$Y=a+bX+e~$

\bigskip I get the following estimated equation:

$\overline{Y}~=-0.009+0.0996X$

$\ \ \ \ \ \ (0.0641)~\ (3.1742)$

\qquad $(0.4986)~\ (0.0015)$

$R^{2}=0.01$

$Root~MSE~=1.006$

\section{Conclusions}

\bigskip Taking into consideration the aforementioned estimates, the
following conclusions can be drawn:

1. Firstly, the coefficient of X is almost 0.01, as the correlation
coefficient between Y and X. This doesn't surprise us, as the coefficient $b$
in the univariate ols regression, is estimated as the correlation
coefficient, i.e. the ratio between the covariance of X and Y over the
variance of X. 

2. Secondly, this coefficient is statistical significant, with confidence
99.85\%

3. The constant term, $a$, is statistical insignificant, as the p-value of
the estimate is 0.5, i.e. I do not reject the null hypothesis that this term
is equal to 0.

4. $R^{2}~$is~0.01, which also makes sense, as we have a univariate
regression, meaning that Y is explained by X, by 10\%, which is the
correlation coefficient.
